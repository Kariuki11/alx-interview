### Island Perimeter Problem

The **Island Perimeter** problem is a common algorithmic challenge, particularly in coding interviews. Given a 2D grid representing a map where:
- `0` represents water, and
- `1` represents land,

you need to compute the perimeter of the "island." The island is a group of connected `1`s (land cells) where there are no lakes (i.e., water surrounded by land). The perimeter is calculated as the total length of the boundary edges around the island.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. A land cell (`1`) contributes 4 sides to the perimeter.
2. If a land cell has an adjacent land cell (up, down, left, or right), the shared side between them reduces the perimeter by 1 for each adjacency.

### Approach:
- Traverse the grid, and for each land cell (`1`):
  1. Add 4 to the perimeter for the cell.
  2. Check for adjacent land cells in four directions (up, down, left, right). For each adjacent land cell, subtract 1 from the perimeter (because the sides are shared).

### Example:
```python
grid = [
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0]
]
```

The perimeter of the island in this grid is `16`.

### Python Code Solution:

```python
def island_perimeter(grid):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    perimeter = 0
    
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == 1:  # If the current cell is land
                perimeter += 4  # Add 4 sides for the current cell
                
                # Check all 4 directions
                if r > 0 and grid[r-1][c] == 1:  # Up
                    perimeter -= 1
                if r < rows - 1 and grid[r+1][c] == 1:  # Down
                    perimeter -= 1
                if c > 0 and grid[r][c-1] == 1:  # Left
                    perimeter -= 1
                if c < cols - 1 and grid[r][c+1] == 1:  # Right
                    perimeter -= 1
    return perimeter
```

### Example Usage:
```python
grid = [
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0]
]
print(island_perimeter(grid))  # Output: 16
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)** where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. You visit every cell exactly once and check its neighbors in constant time.

### Potential Interview Questions:

1. **Basic Understanding**:
   - Can you explain the problem in your own words?
   - How would you approach calculating the perimeter for a given grid?

2. **Optimization**:
   - Can you improve the solution to avoid checking cells multiple times?
   - What is the time complexity of your solution?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What happens if there is no land at all in the grid?
   - How does your solution handle a grid with multiple islands (though the problem might assume thereâ€™s only one island)?

4. **Variations**:
   - How would you handle the case if there are lakes (water completely surrounded by land)?
   - What if the grid is infinite, with water extending indefinitely beyond the edges?

5. **Follow-up questions**:
   - How would you calculate the perimeter if the island can wrap around the grid edges (toroidal grid)?
   - How would you modify the solution to return the perimeter of the largest island if there are multiple islands?

This problem is typically used to test knowledge of grid traversal, boundary conditions, and managing shared edges between elements in a grid.
