What is UTF-8 Validation?
UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit) is a variable-width character encoding used for electronic communication. It can represent every character in the Unicode character set, making it one of the most popular encodings on the web. UTF-8 encodes each character in one to four bytes, depending on the character. The primary purpose of UTF-8 validation is to ensure that a given sequence of bytes correctly represents a valid UTF-8 encoded string.

Why is UTF-8 Validation Important?
Security: Invalid UTF-8 sequences can be used in security exploits, such as buffer overflows. By validating UTF-8 sequences, you can prevent potential vulnerabilities in applications that process user input.

Data Integrity: Ensuring that text data is correctly encoded in UTF-8 helps maintain the integrity of the data when it's stored, processed, or transmitted.

Compatibility: Many systems and protocols expect text to be in UTF-8. Invalid sequences can cause errors or data corruption when interacting with such systems.

How Does UTF-8 Validation Work?
The validation process involves checking that the byte sequence adheres to the rules of UTF-8 encoding:

Single-byte characters (ASCII): Characters from U+0000 to U+007F are encoded in a single byte, with the most significant bit set to 0. This means any byte in the range 0x00 to 0x7F is valid by itself.

Multi-byte characters:

2-byte sequences: Characters from U+0080 to U+07FF are encoded in two bytes. The first byte must start with the bits 110, and the second byte must start with 10.
3-byte sequences: Characters from U+0800 to U+FFFF are encoded in three bytes. The first byte starts with 1110, and the subsequent bytes start with 10.
4-byte sequences: Characters from U+10000 to U+10FFFF are encoded in four bytes. The first byte starts with 11110, and the subsequent bytes start with 10.
Invalid sequences: Some byte sequences are explicitly invalid, such as overlong encodings (using more bytes than necessary to encode a character) or sequences that represent code points outside the valid range (e.g., greater than U+10FFFF).

The validation algorithm typically involves:

Checking that the byte length matches the expected length based on the leading byte.
Ensuring that continuation bytes start with 10.
Rejecting sequences that represent code points outside the valid Unicode range.
Potential Interview Questions on UTF-8 Validation
1. What is UTF-8, and how does it differ from other character encodings?
Answer:
UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit) is a variable-width character encoding capable of encoding all characters in the Unicode character set. It uses 1 to 4 bytes to represent characters. UTF-8 is different from other encodings like UTF-16 and ASCII because:

UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII, where characters from U+0000 to U+007F are represented by single bytes identical to their ASCII counterparts.
UTF-16 uses either 2 or 4 bytes for encoding, which can be less space-efficient for texts with primarily ASCII characters.
ASCII is a fixed-width encoding using a single byte per character but is limited to 128 characters (U+0000 to U+007F).
2. Why is UTF-8 validation important in software development?
Answer:
UTF-8 validation is crucial because:

Security: Invalid UTF-8 sequences can lead to security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or injection attacks.
Data Integrity: Proper validation ensures that text data is stored and processed correctly, avoiding corruption.
Compatibility: Many systems and protocols expect UTF-8 encoded text. Invalid sequences can cause errors or corruption when interfacing with these systems.
3. Describe the structure of a UTF-8 encoded character.
Answer:
UTF-8 encoding uses 1 to 4 bytes to represent characters:

1-byte characters (ASCII): Use a single byte with the most significant bit set to 0 (0x00 to 0x7F).
2-byte sequences: Start with 110 followed by a continuation byte starting with 10.
3-byte sequences: Start with 1110 followed by two continuation bytes starting with 10.
4-byte sequences: Start with 11110 followed by three continuation bytes starting with 10.
Each type of sequence has specific bit patterns that ensure the correct interpretation of the character.

4. How would you implement a UTF-8 validation algorithm?
Answer:
To implement a UTF-8 validation algorithm:

Identify the sequence length: Based on the leading byte (e.g., 0xxxxxxx for 1-byte, 110xxxxx for 2-byte).
Check continuation bytes: Ensure that continuation bytes (starting with 10xxxxxx) follow the leading byte as expected.
Reject overlong sequences: Validate that characters are not represented with more bytes than necessary.
Check the range: Ensure the sequence represents a valid Unicode code point (within U+0000 to U+10FFFF).
5. What are overlong encodings, and why should they be rejected?
Answer:
Overlong encodings are sequences where a character is represented with more bytes than necessary. For example, the ASCII character 'A' (U+0041) could be incorrectly encoded using two or more bytes. These should be rejected because:

They violate the standard UTF-8 encoding rules.
They can be exploited in attacks, such as bypassing filters or triggering buffer overflows.
6. Can you explain a situation where failing to validate UTF-8 encoding could lead to a security vulnerability?
Answer:
One scenario involves buffer overflow attacks. An attacker might inject a specially crafted invalid UTF-8 sequence that, when processed, overflows the buffer and allows arbitrary code execution. Similarly, invalid sequences could bypass input validation, leading to vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

7. How do you handle invalid UTF-8 sequences in a system that processes text data?
Answer:
There are several strategies to handle invalid UTF-8 sequences:

Reject the input: Discard any data containing invalid sequences.
Replace invalid sequences: Use a replacement character (e.g., U+FFFD, the Unicode replacement character) to substitute invalid bytes.
Log errors: Record the invalid input for further analysis, ensuring that the issue can be traced and fixed without disrupting the system.
