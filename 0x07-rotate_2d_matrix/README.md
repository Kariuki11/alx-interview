A **2D matrix rotation** problem is common in technical interviews, particularly for software development roles. The task is typically to rotate a given 2D matrix (or array) 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. Understanding how to rotate matrices and demonstrating efficiency in doing so can highlight your problem-solving skills.

### Explanation:
Given an `n x n` matrix (a square matrix), rotating it 90 degrees clockwise involves transforming the rows of the matrix into columns.

### Steps to Rotate a Matrix 90 Degrees Clockwise:
1. **Transpose the matrix** – Convert rows into columns (swap elements across the diagonal).
2. **Reverse each row** – Once transposed, reverse each row to achieve a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

### Example:
Let's say we have a `3x3` matrix:

```
1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9
```

#### Step 1: Transpose the matrix
```
1  4  7
2  5  8
3  6  9
```

#### Step 2: Reverse each row
```
7  4  1
8  5  2
9  6  3
```

The result is the original matrix rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

### Python Code Example:
```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    # Step 1: Transpose the matrix
    n = len(matrix)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
    
    # Step 2: Reverse each row
    for i in range(n):
        matrix[i].reverse()

# Example usage:
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)
print(matrix)
```

### Output:
```
[
    [7, 4, 1],
    [8, 5, 2],
    [9, 6, 3]
]
```

### Potential Interview Questions:
1. **Basic matrix rotation:**
   - *Problem:* Rotate a given `n x n` matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
   - **Follow-up:** How would you modify the algorithm to rotate it 90 degrees counterclockwise?

2. **Memory constraints:**
   - *Question:* Can you rotate the matrix in-place without using extra memory? (i.e., modifying the matrix directly without using an additional matrix for intermediate steps).
   - *Solution:* Implement a solution similar to the above code where you first transpose the matrix and then reverse each row.

3. **Time and Space Complexity:**
   - *Question:* What is the time complexity of your solution? What is the space complexity?
   - *Answer:* The time complexity is `O(n^2)` because we visit each element in the matrix once. The space complexity is `O(1)` since the rotation is done in-place.

4. **Generalized matrix rotation:**
   - *Problem:* What if the matrix is not square (i.e., an `m x n` matrix)? How would your approach change?
   - *Answer:* For a non-square matrix, you'd need a more complex approach, but a common workaround is using extra space to store the result in a new matrix.

5. **Edge cases:**
   - *Question:* How does your solution handle edge cases such as:
     - A 1x1 matrix?
     - An empty matrix?
     - A matrix with negative numbers or non-integer elements?
