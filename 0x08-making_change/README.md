To solve the problem of finding the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount, we can think of it as a step-by-step process:

### Problem Understanding:
- You are given a collection of coins of different values, and you need to determine the minimum number of coins needed to add up to a specific total amount.
- If the total amount is zero or less, the answer is simply zero because no coins are needed.
- If it's impossible to achieve the total with the given coins, the result should be -1.

### Approach:
We can approach this problem using **dynamic programming**, which is a technique to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler sub-problems and solving them one by one.

### Explanation:
1. **Initialize a list to store results**: 
   - We create a list (or array) where each index represents a certain amount of money, from 0 up to the given total. This list will store the minimum number of coins needed to make each amount.
   - For example, the value at index 0 would represent the minimum coins needed to make a total of 0 (which is always 0). The value at index 5 would store the minimum number of coins needed to make a total of 5.

2. **Fill the list step by step**:
   - We start by filling in the value for making a total of 1, then 2, then 3, and so on, up to the total amount.
   - For each amount, we check if we can make it by using any of the available coins. For example, to make a total of 5, we check if using one of the coins (like a 2 or a 3) gets us closer to the total.

3. **Minimizing the number of coins**:
   - For each amount, we look at all the possible ways to make that amount by considering each coin in the list. 
   - For example, if you’re trying to make a total of 10 and you have a coin of 5, you check how many coins were needed to make 5 (which you already know from the previous steps) and add 1 (because you're using one more coin, the coin of 5).
   - We update the total for 10 with the fewest number of coins we found across all options.

4. **Handling impossible totals**:
   - If you can't make a certain amount with the given coins, that amount will still have a very large number assigned to it (since no solution was found). After calculating the results for all amounts, if the value for the total amount remains large, it means it’s impossible to achieve that total with the given coins, and we return -1.

### Final Check:
- Once we've filled out the list for all amounts up to the target total, we check the value stored for the target. If it’s still large, it means the total can't be made with the available coins, so the result is -1. Otherwise, we return the value, which represents the minimum number of coins needed.
